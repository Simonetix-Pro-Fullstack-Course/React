# React Validator

Recreate a validator in React. Your final product should function similarly to [this deployed version](http://excellent-tail.surge.sh) of the component.


## Instructions

Take the existing markup rendered from the `Validator` component in `src/Validator.js` and change into a fully functioning component. This means that you only have to add functionality -- not markup or styling -- to the existing code!

## Getting Started

For this exercise, don't be concerned about the distinction between container and presentational components. 

1. Add your form inputs in `Validator.js`.
2. Add a constructor method and initialize state. Your state should include `email`, `password`, `passwordConfirm`, and `valid` properties.

```jsx
    this.state = {
      email: '',
      password: '',
      passwordConfirm: '',
      valid: true
    }
```

3. Add methods for handling inputs for password and password confirm, and checking that the passwords match. Be sure to update state in these methods using `.setState`
4. Bind the methods in the constructor.
5. Display a message if the user's inputs are valid.
