# React Shopping Cart

Recreate a shopping cart page in React. Your final product should function similarly to [this deployed version](http://oceanic-sense.surge.sh/) of the component.

## Instructions

Take the existing markup rendered from the `ShoppingCart` component in `src/index.js` and change into a fully functioning component. This means that you only have to add functionality -- not markup or styling -- to the existing code!
